# Game of Life Application

## Overview

This application is an example exercise which takes advantage of using AngularJS, Yeoman, Grunt, Bower, Karma, Jasmine and other JS libraries.

It demonstrates the techniques by completing an exercise.  See below for the full exercise details.


## Prerequisites

### Git
- A good place to learn about setting up git is [here][git-github]
- Git [home][git-home] (download, documentation)

### Node.js
- Generic [installation instructions][node-generic].
- Mac DMG [here][node-mac]
- Windows download from [here][node-windows]. (You will also need [7 Zip] to unzip the node archive)
  (and don't forget to add `node.exe` to  your executable path)

### Yeoman
- You really just need a server or Grunt but since it's easy enough - one can install yeoman
	npm install -g yo
 

## Workings of the application

- To start the server type: 
	grunt server

## Exercise

Write some code that evolves generations through the "game of life".

The input will be a game board of cells, either alive (1) or dead (0).

The code should take this board and create a new board for the next generation based on the following rules:
1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (under-population)
2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation (survival)
3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (overcrowding)
4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell (reproduction)

As an example, this game board as input:
0 1 0 0 0
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
0 1 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 1

Will have a subsequent generation of:
0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
